# Python-Assignment-Project

This is my Python Assignment Project. Me and my teammate have created a Car Rental System.
My teammate is Ang Weoy Yang and you can find him in GitHub (Ang-dot).

For this Python Program, you have to download the car details, login details and car brands in order to access the functions in it.
